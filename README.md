## Background

As `.env.*` is added to the `.gitignore`, anyone who wishes to clone this repo will not have access to the necessary environment variables. 

You will need to create two .env files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). If you need any help, please reference documentation
