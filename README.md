# Northcoders News API

## Background

As `.env.*` is added to the `.gitignore`, anyone who wishes to clone this repo will not have access to the necessary environment variables. 

You will need to create two .env files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. In `.env.test` add `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test` into the file and in  `.env.development` add `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`. With the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). If you need any help, please reference documentation
